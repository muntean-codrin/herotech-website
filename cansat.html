                    <p style="text-align:justify "> <i>A CanSat is a simulation of a real satellite, integrated within
                            the volume and shape of a soft drink can. The challenge for the students is to fit all the
                            major subsystems found in a satellite, such as power, sensors and a communication system,
                            into this minimal volume. The CanSat is then launched to an altitude of a few hundred metres
                            by a rocket or dropped from a platform or captive balloon and its mission begins: to carry
                            out a scientific experiment and achieve a safe landing. </i> - <a

                        The mission we have chosen consists in a guided airdrop system. The CanSat should be able to
                        guide itself during the fall by pulling the strings attached to the parachute with the target of
                        landing in a nearby area relative to the dropping point. This presents a great potential in the
                        development of an air drop package delivering system for faster and more convenient delivery
                        which does not require human interaction. It is also a solution for dropping necessary items to
                        people in need or for military drops. A CanSat of this size cannot carry much since it’s light,
                        but the project can be scaled to handle small items such as food packages, a medical kit and
                        other similar-sized objects. The most important part of our mission is the control system. The
                        exact position of our landing cannot be achieved with a lot of interfering factors, but we
                        strive for stability. In order to call the mission a success we have the following goals:
                        landing of the CanSat without damaging the carcass or the internal systems, correctly reading
                        data provided by sensors for further analysing and guiding the CanSat for landing with high
                        accuracy in the designated area.

                    <p style="text-align:justify">
                        The CanSats mission objective is to collect data while descending with the help of a parachute
                        and land in a designated area having a radius of no more than 25 meters. The mission begins with
                        the CanSat being in a state of low battery usage. After being thrown from an altitude of 1km,
                        its parachute immediately opens. Data from the accelerometer is continuously being sent to the
                        main board, which will detect the beginning of the fall, switching all other functions on. While
                        falling, the mainboard saves data on a secure digital card regarding altitude, temperature,
                        pressure, geographic coordinates which are being read from a gps and a pressure sensor. For the
                        CanSats navigation, the global position at a point in time is determined by the gps. The CanSats
                        forward vector is determined by a magnetometer device whose tilt is compensated by the
                        accelerometer and gyroscope. Comparing the current position to the target landing destination
                        the CanSat will determine which direction it should face, and 4 motors will control the
                        parachute to go to that direction by extending or retracting the ropes connected to the
                        parachute. After landing the CanSat will switch to a low power mode, stopping data collection
                        and turning on a buzzer to facilitate its recovery.

                                The CanSat was firstly designed using Autodesk Fusion 360, where all the 3D printed
                                parts were modelled. We started by creating a maximum volume to make sure that
                                everything we design was in parameters. The first step was to place all the boards on
                                top of each other, leaving as little space as possible between them. The second step was
                                to find and buy a suitable battery to fit in the CanSat. We decided to use one LiPo 800
                                mAh 7.4 V accumulator. Next, we started modelling the parts necessary to close and
                                protect the circuitry, keeping in mind the fact that they had to hold up at 20G of
                                acceleration. After all the required parts were modelled, we started printing the using
                                PLA as we decided that it’s properties would best suit the purpose of the CanSat and
                                assure proper strength. We were aware that the GPS would run at quite a high
                                temperature, so we measured it (70° C) and it was too high for a PLA board to not deform
                                at that temperature, especially at a high G force during launch. Due to this fact, we
                                decided to use ABS to print it which is a better thermoplastic than PLA when it comes to
                                temperature resistance. When all the pieces were put together, we used the remaining
                                space to incorporate the Parachute control assembly. The motors have a gear reduction of
                                210 to 1, giving us a high torque to pull the strings of the parachute. After printing
                                all the parts, we assembled the CanSat using two M2 threaded rods that go through the
                                whole CanSat and keep all pieces in place. For extra protection, the CanSat is covered
                                in a two-piece wall that also connects to the Parachute control assembly to provide more
                                stability. We are using plastic M2 nuts with 3D printed spacers between the boards to be
                                sure we are not tightening the nuts too hard, damaging the PCB. This assembly forms the
                                upper part of the CanSat and its purpose is to steer the parachute, allowing us to
                                attempt a guided landing. We are using 4 DC micromotors, each one of them connected to
                                the body of the CanSat with 3 3D printed parts that clamp them together with the use of
                                two long M4 Screws. The printed parts are secured to the rest of the CanSat in 4 points:
                                2 by the M2 rod and 2 by pressing the sides in the outer walls, providing a tight fit
                                and ease of removal. To each one of the motors, 3D printed pulleys are attached that
                                allow the length of the strings of the parachute to be completely controlled. With this
                                in mind, we can completely steer the parachute, which is a paraglider, by pulling on the
                                side strings, or even slowing the descent rate by pulling all the strings
                                simultaneously. The motors are provided with encoders that we use to make sure the
                                parachute is correctly controlled.

                                by pressing the sides in the outer walls, providing a tight fit and ease of removal.

                                With this in minde, we can completely steer the parachute, which is a paraglider, by
                                pulling on the side strings, or even slowing the descent rate by pulling all the strings
                                simultaneously.
                                The motors are provided with encoders that we use to make sure the parachute is

                                To recover our CanSat after deployment we decided to use a paraglider, which plays a big
                                part of our secondary mission, where we are attempting a directed landing.
                                Using the command lines of the paraglider which are connected to the Parachute control
                                system, we are going to steer the CanSat. It will be attached to the CanSat through the
                                3D printed top in multiple points (in dedicated holes, around the motor axes) to make
                                sure they are secure. The paraglider will be made from a light, impermeable material.

                                    By pulling on both lines at the same time we can decrease the drag coefficient,
                                    increasing the velocity of descend.

                                We calculated the necessary area of the parachute, getting the value of approximatively
                                0.085 square meters to reach the target velocity of 8 meters per second, with an
                                approximate flight time of 150 seconds.

                                With this in mind we started designing the parachute, which proved to be an incredibly
                                difficult task due to the complex airfoil shape of the paraglider, and the necessity to
                                be made of multiple cells. At the moment of writing, we decided that the first parachute
                                we designed in Fusion 360 is a bad idea and we are waiting for a toy kite shaped like a
                                paraglider to test.

                                We started with the idea of developing our own printed circuit boards in order to make a
                                customized application with the appropriate requirements. After a well documentation on
                                the available microcontrollers, we decided to use an Arm Cortex M0 processor, being one
                                of the smallest 32 bit processors available on the market. The decision was based on its
                                performance, power consumption, programming accessibility and price. We use the
                                ATSAMD21G18 microcontroller which is ideal for a wide range of automation and industrial
                                applications. It has 256 KB of flash and 32 KB of SRAM with an operating frequency up to
                                48 Mhz. One of the main advantages of this family of microcontrollers is the serial
                                communication module (SERCOM), configurable as UART, SPI and I2C. Another characteristic
                                that was crucial for our application was the PWM generator capability, having 20 PWM
                                configurable channels. The power supply range is between 1.62 V and 3.63 with a low
                                power consumption. The idle and sleep modes are available for this chip as well as many
                                others useful features for a complex embedded system. It comes in a variety of 48 pin
                                packages, but we chose the TQFP one for soldering purposes.

                                Initially we planned to use the microcontroller on a customed board, but when we
                                realized that the programming part was quite difficult (the available libraries were not
                                compatible with the hardware), we decided to use the same design as an Adafruit Feather
                                M0. In this way, the programming was more accessible because any available library could
                                be easily implemented in our project. We use the same pins as the Feather M0 with small
                                modifications.

                                After choosing the uC, we started designing the schematic of our project. Being just a
                                test board, just the Uc, a radio communication module, and a temperature and pressure
                                sensor were integrated as well as the required auxiliaries (the power supply, the micro
                                USB, SWD). We left all the pun headers available for further applications on the test
                                board. We designed it in Altium because we had a free student license at that time. It
                                was a challenge for our team to work with such a performant design software, but in the
                                end all the experience was totally a success. The schematic was designed accordingly to
                                the information specified by the supplier in the datasheet. We followed the recommended
                                typical application schematic and layout. After we designed the schematic and the layout
                                of the PCB-s, we manufactured them with a specialized company. In all iterations of the
                                board, we used 0805 SMD packages for the ceramic capacitors and resistors.

                                mounting, we use 2 2mm diameter holes. All of the

                                reliable because they have a low current consumption (max 650 mA) and a 6V operating

                                For the temperature and pressure sensor we use the MPL3115A1 from NXP, BNO055 from BOSCH
                                as an IMU and an u-Blox SAM M8Q as a GPS. The IMU and the temperature and pressure are
                                designed in a small PCB-s with castellated holes on the edges. These are mounted on the
                                board that contains the GPS module. The schematic for these two small boards are really
                                simple, they require just a few capacitors for filtering and some pull-up resistors. The
                                temperature sensor was easily solderd on the board using a hot air station, but the
                                BNO055 was quite difficlt to solder because it comes in a small package and after the
                                soldering, we noticed few short circuits between the pads under the chip. Although we
                                managed to solder it properly, we did not have the proper equipement for the soldering
                                process, so we decided to use another IMU in the next iteration of the sensors board.
                                Unfortunatelly, we did not manage to solder the GPS module properly because it has pins
                                on a big area and the internal components were damaged during the porcess.

                                This version came with a proper layout for the GPS module and another IMU. We chose to
                                replace
                                the BNO055 IMU with ICM 20948 for soldering purposes. The only issue was the operating
                                voltage
                                of this IMU: it works with 1.8 V, fact that forced us to use a 1.8V regulator and a
                                logic level converter
                                for the I2C interface.
                                MCP1824 1.8 Vreg is used as a regulator and it provides high current (300 mA), short
                                circuit current
                                limiting and overtemperature protection.
                                The logic level shifting is achieved by 2 N-Channel MOSFET Transistors (BSS138LT7G)
                                placed on
                                SCL and SDA lines. They come in a small package and the threshold voltage is ideal for
                                our
                                application (0.85 V – 1.5V).
                                Also, in this version we integrated a battery for GPS backup. In each iteration the
                                buzzer circuit
                                remains unchanged.
                                Basically, it is just a transistor that acts like a switch, opening the circuit
                                when on base is applied a logic high.

                                A fourth iteration of the sensors board was necessary since we were not happy with the
                                result of the
                                CAM-M8Q's output of data. Inside, the GPS would not be able to receive data from
                                satellites, and
                                when tested outside it would only work sometimes. We decided to test another GPS that we
                                had in
                                the laboratory: the u-Blox Neo-6M. This GPS offered much better results since it had a
                                much bigger
                                and specialized antenna. We ended using this GPS since it satisfied our needs in term of
                                accuracy
                                and signal strength, but we faced difficulties while connecting it to our mainboard
                                since we didn’t
                                have enough free pins. To have the GPS communicate through UART, the board needed to
                                have 2
                                free pins on the same SERCOM. This was made possible by giving up a led and a motor

                                damage of sensible components. After we soldered every PCB, we connected them together
                                using
                                proper connectors for the JST SH 1mm pin headers. Although it required special
                                attention, we
                                crimped our own wires using an Engineer PAD 11 crimper tool.
                                After we made sure each sensor works and sends proper data, we tested the system by
                                connecting
                                it to a lab power supply with current analyzer and having the board request data from

                                at a small interval of time. The results were close to those calculated on paper before,
                                about 375 mA.
                                After studying its behavior and confirming that the system is stable, we tested powering
                                the CanSat
                                with a LiPo battery with a capacity of 800mA and an output of 7.4V. With the battery

                                and every sensor and motor in use the system stayed online for about 2.1 hours. On power

                                Our CanSats main board controller uses an ATSAMD21G18 chip. We burned a bootloader from
                                Adafruit to it so that it could act as an Adafruit feather m0 board. This was possible
                                because feather
                                m0 uses the same ATSAMD21G18 as a processor. This helped us by opening the possibility

                                an Arduino as an IDE to help write, manage and upload C++ code to the board. Another

                                system.

                                Phase 1 – Before Launch. The CanSat will boot up the program at starting. It will
                                calibrate the sensors
                                and make the RGB led green if everything is working properly and the CanSat is ready to
                                start its
                                mission. A blue light is used to indicate a partial initialization, for example if a
                                sensor fails due to
                                different reasons. This is not ideal but the CanSat will be able to complete its mission
                                partly. It is
                                recommended to reboot from the switch if a blue light is showing. A red led is used when
                                a fatal
                                error occurs. This means that the CanSat will not be able to control its descent, or it
                                will not be able
                                to store data collected during it. This phase is working in a low power mode, reading
                                data only from
                                the accelerometer to determine when to switch to the next phase. We are averaging from
                                multiple
                                readings in order to validate the data and not switch to the next phase if the sensor
                                outputs an
                                erroneous value.

                                Phase 2 – Launch phase. This phase starts when the CanSat detects getting dropped out of
                                the
                                plane/helicopter. At this point the main board will read data from all sensors and will
                                save them to
                                the SD card at a rate of 200 MHz The read data consists of relative time since start,
                                acceleration in
                                the Z axis, pressure, altitude, temperature, longitude, latitude, battery voltage. At
                                the same time, the
                                yaw angle of our CanSat is calculated from the readings of the ICM20948 sensor. The
                                CanSat will
                                always move in the direction of the parachute’s forward vector, so by knowing the yaw
                                angle we also
                                know in which direction the CanSat is heading. We calculate the direction in which the
                                CanSat should
                                be heading by subtracting the landing target coordinates from the current position
                                coordinates and
                                evaluating the arctangent of their division. For turning the CanSat to the desired
                                heading we send
                                commands to the motors in order to retract the ropes. The side where we retract the
                                ropes will act
                                as a pivot for the spinning motion, and the heading will be adjusted, moving the CanSat
                                toward the
                                targeted landing spot.

                                Phase 3 – After Landing. The CanSat will detect the landing with the help of the
                                accelerometer, using
                                the same concept as the for the launch. After that it will record the GPS position in
                                order to compare
                                it to the targets landing spot and will start the buzzer. It will disable all sensor
                                readings, since the
                                mission has ended and data collection is no longer needed, and since power should be
                                conversed
                                for the battery to last until the CanSat is recovered.

                                We did not find a library for this RGB led that is compatible with Arduino, so we wrote our own by
                                consulting the datasheet. In our program we define an object of type TLC59108 to which we pass
                                the reset pin in the constructor. We defined different methods for this object such as setColor(r, g, b)
                                to which we pass 3 values from 0 to 255, each representing the intensity of the red, green and blue
                                channels.

                                To read data from this IMU we are using the Sparkfun 9DoF IMU Breakout Arduino Library. By
                                enabling the Digital Motion Processor, the library is able to output the orientation calculated from the
                                fusion of the sensor data from the 3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer and 3-axis compass in
                                either Euler or quaternion format. For calculating the compass heading we could technically only use
                                the magnetometer, but the output value would change drastically with a change in roll and pitch of
                                the CanSat. We have to make up for that by plugging those angles in our equations:

                                of relying on a feed forward solution in order to actuate the motors, we have a closed loop solution
                                which should be able to generate better results for our descent control system.
